    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Flour</li>
      <li>Sugar</li>
      <li>Baking Powder</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
      <li>An Egg</li>
      <li>Milk</li>
      <li>Vegetable Oil</li>
      <li>Bananas</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Mix <br>
        Combine your dry ingredients (flour, sugar, salt, baking powder) in one
        bowl and your wet ingredients (egg, milk, vegetable oil, mashed bananas)
        in another bowl. Add the dry ingredients to the bowl with the wet
        ingredients, then stir until they're incorporated. It's OK if your
        batter is slightly lumpy.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook <br>
        Pour the batter in Â¼ cup portions onto a lightly oiled pan or griddle
        over medium-high heat. Cook for a few minutes, flip with a spatula, and
        cook for another few minutes (or until each side is golden brown).
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve <br>
        Serve your banana pancakes immediately. They're delicious alone or with
        your favorite pancake toppings.
